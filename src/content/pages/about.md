Thanks so much for checking out my personal website. The other tabs on this site have explored some of the formal depictions of who I amâ€”what I studied, where I have worked, the exciting projects I have completed, and my creative portfolio.

**Born a dreamer. Raised an achiever. Being a Mechatronics Engineering graduate is merely the tip of the iceberg. In addition to robotics and electronics, my passion lies in art and athletics. I see robotics as an art of it's own and collaborating electronics and art is the effective way to solving real problems of this world. Coming from a very under-developed country that is Zimbabwe, I have grown to realize that the role that I, as a Mechatronics engineer have in Zimbabwe, South Africa, as well as Africa as a whole, is to be an integral part of Africa's infrastructural development.**

**Upon graduating, I plan on working full-time at a Robotics company as a Robotics Process Automation (RPA) Engineer. Once settled in and experienced enough, I intend to use the skills that i would have acquired to make the world a better place through providing sustainable technology and innovative solutions to the people.**
