**You'll see an image showing a line sensing robot we created and programmed from scratch to follow a black line. It also had to sense an obstacle and stop 10cm away from it. Infra-red LEDs and photo-diodes were used to make the sensors. Coding the H-bridge and the STM Microcontroller was an amazing experience.**
